# Machine Learning technique on PET block detector development
---

## Introduction

  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner is a nuclear biomedical imaging 
  system that has important application in cancer diagnostics and therapy. It 
  consists of the nuclear detection system, front-end electronics, data 
  acquisition electronics, control system, mechanical gantry, and tomographic
  reconstruction algorithm, among which, the nuclear detection system is the 
  main component that determines several key characteristic performance, e.g. 
  the spatial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

### Part 1 - Generate crystal lookup table for PQS PET block detector using Machine Learning techniques

* [This is the python code that create the lookup table for the PET block 
  detector from the flood map (2D map)](https://github.com/yzhang3000/Machine-Learning-Technique-on-PET-block-detector-development-Part1/blob/master/python/PET_detector_block_01.ipynb)
* If you get "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?", try to reload. 
* If you still cannot load the jupyter notebook file, you can load the [markdown file](https://github.com/yzhang3000/Machine-Learning-Technique-on-PET-block-detector-development-Part1/blob/master/python/PET_detector_block_01.md) instead.
